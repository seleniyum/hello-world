/*I like learning and teaching selenium web automation
Basically You have to know little bit about web technologies, 
and websites in general - how they are built, how they are maintained
etc. It is Ok to be completely a newbie in the field of programming
as long as you are willing to give it a complete commitment for next
4 weeks. */
